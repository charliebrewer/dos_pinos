      <h2>Member Contribution</h2>

      <p>
        All Dos Pinos members are expected to contribute to the community with a
        minimum of 2 hours per month of service. This can be fulfilled by
        service on the Board, on committees, or through a variety of individual
        activities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Dos Pinos Board, comprised of individual shareholder members, is
        responsible for identifying and creating committees. They are designed
        to facilitate and help the Board with some tasks it cannot do and to
        meet our community’s needs. Committees provide residents a meaningful
        way to contribute to the tasks required to manage the business of our
        cooperative community through deliberation and thoughtful research of
        alternative programs, products and processes. Working with the Board and
        within a community structure and guidelines, these committees are
        empowered to make recommendations, decisions and implement activities to
        meet objectives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Committee work is valuable for the community and the individual. On an
        individual level, committee participation gives its members a unique
        experience in how our cooperative community works. Committee
        participation helps expand the shareholder’s global perspective of the
        cooperative management needs of Dos Pinos. This personal and more global
        perspective and sense of participation may encourage the individual
        shareholders to become candidates for Board service.
      </p>

      <p>Descriptions of the goals of Dos Pinos committees include:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Education and Communication</b>. To facilitate understanding and
          appreciation of our community and the policies and procedures by which
          we operate — for new members, our Dos Pinos community, and those
          assuming leadership positions; to facilitate communication within our
          cooperative community; and to support and encourage the culture of
          cooperation, community, and respect.

        <li>

        <li>

        A unique feature, one of the strengths of any housing cooperative, is
        the participation of its residents. Working together, we help keep costs
        down and enhance our sense of community. It is essential that all
        members participate, whether through service on the Board, serving on a
        committee, or contributing on an individual basis.
