        Members (Residents) elect a seven-person Board of Directors that sets
        policy for the Cooperative. The Board is advised and assisted by a
        professional management firm. There is also a paid on-site maintenance
        person. Committees propose policies to the Board and in turn carry out
        proposed assignments, all of which help keep the cooperative running
        smoothly.
