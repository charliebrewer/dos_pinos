      <p>A Brief History of Dos Pinos</p>

      <p>
        The California laws for creating limited equity housing cooperatives
        were put in place in 1979. In 1985, the Dos Pinos development was the
        brainchild of Sweetwater Development company (Lou and Karen Fox). They
        owned a great swath of land that they wanted to develop with market rate
        homes, apartments, a shopping complex, etc. Their goal was to get the
        appropriate building permits from the city. The city required the
        developers to satisfy the low-to-moderate income requirement for a part
        of their proposed developments to get permits of the rest. Both parties
        agreed on the option of a limited equity housing cooperative model.
        Hence, Dos Pinos!
      </p>

      <p>
        The developers built the project according to their specifications, with
        only their own ideas, intentions and visions on the table. Contrary to
        some people’s belief that Dos Pinos was “created as an intentional
        community” or “has always been an intentional community,” there was no
        intent of the original shareholders or technically the
        shareholders-to-be—they weren’t included in this process. In intentional
        communities, the most common characteristic is the extensive,
        pre-development activities in which future resident/owners participate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Concrete evidence is even found in our physical plant. Common design
        features of co-housing housing and intentional communities usually
        include buildings clustered around a large common house with large
        kitchen or doors facing each other and opening into a large communal
        space. Instead Dos Pinos has a small community room, which is not
        centrally located and which has a very small kitchen. Our front doors
        all open to one direction–south—not toward each other. The window
        facings—mostly north and south–were chosen for passive solar design and
        energy conservation.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the building of Dos Pinos, the developer started selling shares
        to prospective members through a sales agent hired for the task, i.e.,
        the builders started the project and then, as any developer must, went
        out to find buyers. Committed shareholders-to-be were able to move in
        from the fall of 1985 as renters. During this time, the developer hired
        the first management company and a lawyer to write the Bylaws according
        to state law that created limited equity cooperatives in preparation for
        the turnover to the members of the cooperative.
      </p>

      <p>
        Per the California law, by the time the developer sold 80% of the
        available shares (48 shares out of 60), we legally became a cooperative
        and “kicked out the landlord.” The real work of creating the guts and
        soul of the cooperative began. Henceforth, our monthly assessments were
        no longer rents, but monthly assessments paid to the corporation.
      </p>

      <p>
        The developer still held the shares of the 12 other units, rented them
        out, and paid monthly assessments to the cooperative. But the limited
        equity model required the builder to sell at a price close to building
        costs, and because the price of a share made it a good economic decision
        for potential buyers, eventually all of the shares were purchased and
        the developer was totally out of the picture.
      </p>

      <p>
        The original member/shareholders were not a cohesive self-defining group
        of people who knew each other and planned the development. Rather they
        were a group of individual households that bought into the concept of
        affordable housing and the appeal of some level of self-determination
        vs. renting with a landlord fully in control. Since the limited equity
        housing cooperative model is required by law to be organized and
        incorporated as a nonprofit public benefit corporation, the concept of
        consensus decision-making was never an option and is not an option now.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yes! There were meetings of “shareholders-to-be” during the time we were
        renters and even a little before some people moved in. There were
        considerations of policies of the most practical type – parking: who
        gets to park where?, pets: how many are OK? what type?, etc. and
        community room use: how do we allow member use that works for the
        individual as well as for the community? These were just the first
        policies that needed to be determined, even as people were still moving
        in. Because there was no board during this period, these policies were
        agreed upon loosely and then somewhat revised and adopted by the actual
        board once the coop was established. Even here, there was never any
        consensus.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a corporation, most decisions of Dos Pinos must be made by the
        elected board of directors. Of course, a few very important ones are
        left to the whole membership such as Bylaws changes, but the board of
        directors model is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first Board of Directors was elected in early 1986. They had weekly
        meetings that often went past midnight. There was a lot to figure out
        and a lot to do including hiring its first coop management company
        (remember, the complex as rental housing was being managed by a
        management company that had been hired by the developer). As of spring
        2012, Dos Pinos has had six management companies including the initial
        one hired by the developer.
      </p>

      <p>
        The continuing evolution of the Dos Pinos community is a real tribute to
        members, past and present, who may not have come here with any
        expectation beyond finding an affordable place to live, but have worked
        hard to make it much more than that. The hard work of the original
        members and all other past and present members results in what Dos Pinos
        is today, arguably the longest operating, most successful limited equity
        housing cooperative without government subsidy in California.
